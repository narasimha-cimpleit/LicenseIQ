# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend
The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, using Vite, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, Wouter for routing, TanStack Query for state management, and React Hook Form with Zod for validation. UI elements include enhanced contract number and source attribution displays, as well as a comprehensive 6-item navigation menu for clear workflow progression.

## Backend
The backend is an Express.js and TypeScript RESTful API server with a layered service architecture, secure session-based authentication using PostgreSQL and RBAC, and a comprehensive middleware pipeline. It handles automatic contract number generation in the format CNT-YYYY-NNN.

## Database
PostgreSQL is used as the primary database with Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations. It leverages the pgvector extension for vector similarity search of Hugging Face embeddings with HNSW indexing. Neon Database provides scalable, serverless hosting.

## File Management
Contract files are stored securely on the server's filesystem. Multer handles file uploads with validation and metadata tracking.

## AI Integration Services
The platform integrates Groq API (LLaMA 3.1 8B Instant) for contract analysis, summarization, validation, and NLP. Hugging Face Embeddings (BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5) are used for semantic contract matching. The AI pipeline includes automated extraction of key terms, risk assessment, compliance checking, insight generation, and a semantic matching system for sales-to-contract pairing. All AI processing is asynchronous and uses free APIs. A robust `extractAndRepairJSON()` helper ensures proper parsing of AI responses.

## Security & Access Control
A five-tier Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system (owner, admin, editor, viewer, auditor) provides granular permissions. Secure session management is handled in PostgreSQL, and comprehensive audit logging tracks user actions. Zod schema validation is applied across all API endpoints.

## Data Models & Schema
The system uses a relational data model with core entities like Users, Contracts, Contract Analysis, Sales Data, Royalty Calculations, and Audit Trails, with Drizzle ORM ensuring type safety.

## Rules Management System
The system supports both AI-extracted and manually-created royalty rules, stored as FormulaNode JSON expression trees or in dedicated columns. The UI smart-parses FormulaNode structures for volume tiers and seasonal adjustments, and a formula display shows calculation logic. The formula preview accurately merges data from FormulaNode and legacy columns, displaying complete volume tiers and seasonal adjustments, along with source attribution.

## Royalty Calculation Dashboard
Features include gradient metric cards, interactive charts (Recharts), and a formula preview system. Users can trigger calculations with custom date ranges, track run history, and generate professional PDF invoices (detailed and summary) using html-pdf-node. The workflow is contract-based, tying sales data to individual contracts.

## RAG-Powered Document Q&A System
An AI-powered chat interface uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for contract inquiries, employing Hugging Face embeddings for semantic search and Groq LLaMA for precise answers with confidence scoring. A smart fallback mechanism uses full contract analysis for low-confidence RAG results. Answers include source citations.

## AI-Driven Sales Matching Workflow
This workflow involves: contract upload & AI analysis, embedding generation and storage (pgvector), sales data import, semantic search to match sales data against contract embeddings, LLM validation of matches with confidence scores, automatic assignment for high-confidence matches, and flagging low-confidence matches for human review.
