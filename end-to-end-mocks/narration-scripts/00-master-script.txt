INTRODUCTION (30 seconds)
========================================

Welcome to License IQ - the intelligent contract management platform that uses 100% free AI to analyze licensing agreements and calculate royalties automatically.

In this demo, I'll show you the complete workflow:
- Uploading and analyzing contracts with AI
- Matching sales data automatically
- Calculating royalties with complex rules
- Generating professional invoices
- And asking questions about your contracts

Let's get started.

========================================
SCREEN 1: CONTRACT UPLOAD (~30 sec)
========================================

First, upload your licensing contract. Simply drag and drop a PDF file.
Our system accepts documents up to 10 megabytes.
For this demo, I'm uploading a plant licensing agreement.
The file is uploading... and ready for AI analysis.

========================================
SCREEN 2: AI ANALYSIS (~35 sec)
========================================

Our AI analyzes the contract using Groq's LLaMA model - completely free.
Watch as it extracts:
- Contract parties and territories
- Important dates and terms
- Payment structures and royalty rules
- Risk assessment and compliance checks

This entire process happens in seconds, powered by advanced language models.
The analysis is complete!

========================================
SCREEN 3: ANALYSIS RESULTS (~45 sec)
========================================

Here are the comprehensive results.

KEY TERMS extracted:
- Evergreen Nurseries as licensor, GreenThumb Retail as licensee
- North American territory with exclusive rights
- Three-year term with auto-renewal

ROYALTY RULES found:
- Volume-based tiered pricing for different products

The system identified 11 automated royalty rules with 92% confidence.
Now let's upload sales data.

========================================

========================================

Upload your sales data in CSV or Excel format.
I'm uploading a quarterly sales report with 156 transactions.

Here's the powerful part: you don't need to manually match sales to contracts.
Our AI does that automatically using semantic search.

========================================
SCREEN 5: AI MATCHING (~40 sec)
========================================

Watch the AI-powered semantic matching:

First, it generates embeddings using Hugging Face's free API.
Then performs vector similarity search to match sales to contract rules.
Groq's LLaMA validates each match with confidence scoring.

Results:
- 142 high-confidence matches processed automatically
- 14 low-confidence matches flagged for review
- 87% average confidence

All in seconds, using completely free AI services.
