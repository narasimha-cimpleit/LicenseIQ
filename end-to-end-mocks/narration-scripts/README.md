## üé¨ How to Use These Scripts

### Option 1: Professional Voice Recording
1. **Text-to-Speech Services:**
   - Use [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) for AI voice generation
   - Use [Murf.ai](https://murf.ai/) for professional voiceovers
   - Use [Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) for scalable TTS

2. **Recording Process:**
   - Import each script file
   - Select a professional voice (recommend: male/female neutral tone)

   - Export as MP3/WAV files

### Option 2: Personal Voice Recording

2. **Recording Tips:**
   - Speak clearly at a moderate pace
   - Pause at [STEP] markers for emphasis

   - Leave 1-2 second pauses between sections

### Option 3: Auto-Generated (Quick)
1. Use built-in browser TTS:
   ```javascript
   const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(scriptText);
   utterance.rate = 0.9; // Slightly slower for clarity
   speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);
   ```
