Duration: ~40 seconds

[INTRO]
Now the magic happens - AI-powered semantic matching.

[STEP 1 - EMBEDDINGS]
First, the system generates embeddings for both the contract rules and sales data using Hugging Face's free API.

[STEP 2 - VECTOR SEARCH]
Then it performs vector similarity search to find the best contract matches for each sale item.
Watch the progress: analyzing 156 sales rows...

[STEP 3 - LLM VALIDATION]
For each potential match, Groq's LLaMA model validates the connection and provides a confidence score.

[STEP 4 - RESULTS]
Look at the results:
- 142 high-confidence matches processed automatically
- 14 low-confidence matches flagged for human review
- Average confidence: 87%

[STEP 5]
All of this happens in seconds, using completely free AI services.

[TRANSITION]
Perfect! The sales are matched. Now let's calculate royalties.
