## 📝 Suggested Narration Script

### **Introduction (30 seconds)**
> "Welcome to License IQ, an AI-powered contract intelligence platform. Today I'll walk you through the complete end-to-end process, from uploading a contract to generating professional invoices—all powered by 100% FREE AI services."

### **Step 1: Contract Upload**
> "First, users upload their PDF contracts using our intuitive drag-and-drop interface. The system tracks all uploads and provides real-time status updates."

### **Step 2: AI Analysis**
> "Our AI, powered by Groq's LLaMA model, automatically analyzes the contract. It extracts key terms, identifies parties, products, and territories, and most importantly, extracts complex royalty formulas—all in under 30 seconds."

### **Step 3: Analysis Results**
> "The analysis results show a comprehensive summary with 95% confidence. You can see extracted royalty rules including volume tiers, seasonal adjustments, and territory premiums. The AI also performs risk assessment and provides strategic insights."

### **Step 4: Sales Upload**
> "Next, users upload their sales data via CSV or Excel. The system shows required columns and provides format examples. No manual vendor selection needed—AI handles the matching automatically."

### **Step 5: AI Semantic Matching**
> "Watch as our AI matches sales transactions to contracts using semantic embeddings and LLM validation. High-confidence matches are auto-approved, while low-confidence ones are flagged for human review. This achieves 95%+ accuracy."

### **Step 6: Royalty Dashboard**
> "The royalty dashboard provides beautiful visualizations with metrics cards showing sales transactions, total sales, and calculated royalties. Users can preview which formulas will apply before running calculations, and view interactive charts showing sales and royalty breakdowns."

### **Step 7: Invoice Generation**
> "After calculation, users can download professional PDF invoices in two formats: a detailed invoice with line-by-line breakdown and calculations, or a summary invoice with high-level totals. Both are generated instantly using PDFKit."

### **Step 8: RAG Q&A**
> "Finally, users can ask questions about their contracts using our RAG-powered assistant. It finds relevant contract sections using semantic search, generates accurate answers with Groq LLaMA, and provides source citations—perfect for compliance and review."

### **Conclusion (20 seconds)**
> "That's the complete License IQ workflow. Remember, all AI processing is 100% FREE using Groq and Hugging Face APIs. The platform handles everything from contract analysis to invoice generation automatically, saving hours of manual work. Thank you for watching!"
