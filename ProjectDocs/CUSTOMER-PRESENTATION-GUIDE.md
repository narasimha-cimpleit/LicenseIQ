## üìû Handling Common Objections

### "We already have SAP/Oracle for this"

**Response:**
"That's great - we integrate directly with [SAP/Oracle]. Many of our customers 
use enterprise ERPs for financial data but found they still calculate royalties 
manually in Excel because ERP royalty modules are:
- 18-month implementations
- $500K-$2M investments
- Rigid and hard to customize

LicenseIQ plugs into your existing SAP/Oracle via API and handles just the 
royalty complexity - 4 weeks, 95% time savings, $60K/year. Think of us as a 
specialized tool that makes your ERP investment more valuable."

---

### "This seems expensive"

**Response:**
"Let's look at your current costs:
- How many hours per quarter on royalty calculations? [Let them answer: ~40 hours]
- What's the fully loaded cost per hour? [Likely $75-$100]
- That's $16K/year in labor alone

Now add:
- 5-10% payment errors ‚Üí $50K/year on $1M royalties
- Audit preparation time ‚Üí $30K/year
- **Total hidden cost: $96K/year**

LicenseIQ at $60K/year saves you $36K immediately, plus you get:
- 100% accuracy (no more errors)
- Instant audit readiness
- Scalability as you grow

The question isn't 'Can we afford it?' but 'Can we afford NOT to automate this?'"

---

### "We need to think about it"

**Response:**
"Absolutely - this is an important decision. To help you think it through, 
would it be useful if I:
1. Set up a free 14-day trial with your actual contracts?
2. Build a custom ROI model with your specific numbers?
3. Connect you with [Similar Company] who implemented last quarter?

What specific questions do you need answered to move forward?"
