AI-Driven License & Royalty Calculation Workflow
 This document outlines a dynamic AI-based approach to automatically map sales data to licensing
 contracts and calculate royalties. The system leverages LLMs (e.g., LLaMA3) and vector databases
 for semantic search, minimizing dependency on static database rules.
 1. Contract Ingestion & Rule Extraction
 • LLM parses contracts and extracts structured rules (product, thresholds, territory, validity). • Rules
 are saved as JSON and indexed in a vector database for semantic search.
 2. Embedding Generation
 • For each contract, embeddings are generated for product descriptions, customers, and territories.
 • Enables fuzzy matching with sales data.
 3. Sales Data Processing
 • Sales data (product, customer, region, date, quantity) is converted into embeddings. • Candidate
 contracts are retrieved dynamically from the vector DB.
 4. Dynamic Contract Matching
 • AI compares sales embeddings against contract embeddings. • Top N candidate contracts are
 shortlisted. • LLM reasons over rules (date validity, thresholds, territory) to select the correct one.
 5. Royalty & Rule Application
 • Once contract is identified, LLM applies extracted rules (discounts, thresholds, royalty rates). •
 Calculates royalty/fees dynamically. • Generates explanations for transparency.
 6. Feedback & Continuous Learning
 • Low-confidence matches are flagged for human review. • User corrections are fed back to improve
 future mappings.
 Minimal Master Data Required
 Master Data
 Purpose
 Product Master (SKU, Category)
 Customer Master (ID, Type, Region)
 Contract Metadata (ID, Dates, Licensee)
 Map sales items to contracts
 Identify applicable contracts
 Validate active contract periods
 Territory / Region Mapping
 Apply territory-specific rules
 Dynamic royalty calculation is feasible using an AI-first approach. Contracts are transformed into
 structured rules via LLMs, sales data is mapped using embeddings, and royalties are applied
automatically. This reduces manual effort and ensures accuracy even when the licensee is
 unknown at the time of processing.
