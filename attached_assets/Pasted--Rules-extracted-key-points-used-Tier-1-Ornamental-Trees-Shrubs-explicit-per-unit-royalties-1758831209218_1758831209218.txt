2) Ambiguities & assumptions I applied (explicit)

The PDF says Secondary Territory has a "royalty premium" but doesn’t state the percent. Assumed +10% secondary territory premium for calculations (kept this explicit so you can change it).

For broad seasonal ranges like "Spring +10–15%", where a specific percent wasn’t assigned to a particular SKU I used the size-specific seasonal adjustment shown in the Tier2 table (e.g., 4-inch +15%, 6-inch +10%).

Discounted rates (Tier1) apply when annual units for that variety+size exceed the threshold (we aggregate annual units across all sales lines for that SKU).

Tier3 minimum annual payment enforcement: the computed per-unit royalties for Cascade Blue Hydrangea are summed for the year; if the annual royalty < that bracket's minimum, the shortfall becomes due.
All assumptions are documented and are changeable in the code I ran.
