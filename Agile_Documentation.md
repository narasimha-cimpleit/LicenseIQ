# LicenseIQ Agile Project Plan
**September 29 - November 12, 2025 | Development Phase 2 (45 Days)**

## Project Overview

Following the successful completion of Epics 1-3 (Core Platform Development, Advanced Features & Integration, and Testing & Launch Preparation), this sprint plan focuses on transforming LicenseIQ into a production-ready enterprise platform with advanced features for large-scale contract management and royalty processing.

### Team Velocity & Sprint Structure
- **Team Velocity**: ~19 story points per sprint
- **Sprint Duration**: 1 week (5 working days)
- **Total Sprints**: 5 sprints (Sprint 4-8)
- **Total Story Points Planned**: 95 points
- **Total Duration**: 45 calendar days

## 📊 Story Point Calculation & Task Distribution Methodology

### Story Point Scale & Complexity Mapping
We use a **modified Fibonacci sequence** for story point estimation:

| Points | Complexity Level | Time Estimate | Team Member Distribution |
|--------|------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| **1 pt** | Trivial | 2-4 hours | 1 developer |
| **2 pts** | Simple | 4-8 hours | 1 developer |
| **3 pts** | Moderate | 1-1.5 days | 1-2 developers |
| **5 pts** | Complex | 2-3 days | 2-3 developers |
| **8 pts** | Very Complex | 3-5 days | 3-4 developers |
| **13 pts** | Epic-level | 1+ weeks | Full team |

### Complexity Factors Considered

#### 1. **Technical Complexity** (40% weight)
- New technology implementation
- Integration complexity with existing systems
- Database schema changes
- API design and implementation
- Security requirements

#### 2. **Domain Complexity** (30% weight)
- Business logic complexity
- Rule engine implementation
- Compliance requirements
- User workflow complexity

#### 3. **Effort & Team Distribution** (20% weight)
- Frontend development effort
- Backend development effort
- Testing requirements
- Documentation needs

#### 4. **Risk & Dependencies** (10% weight)
- External dependencies
- Unknown technical challenges
- Integration risks with third-party services

### Task Distribution Strategy

#### Sprint Team Composition (5 members)
- **2 Full-Stack Developers**: Core development work
- **1 Frontend Specialist**: UI/UX implementation
- **1 Backend Specialist**: API and database work
- **1 QA Engineer**: Testing and validation

### Example Story Point Breakdown

#### US-501: Security Hardening & Compliance (8 points)
**Complexity Analysis:**
- **Technical Complexity**: High (7/10) - MFA, encryption, audit logging
- **Domain Complexity**: High (8/10) - GDPR compliance, security standards
- **Effort**: High (8/10) - Multiple team members required
- **Risk**: Medium (6/10) - External auth service dependencies

**Task Distribution:**
```
Day 1-2: Backend Developer + Security Specialist
├── MFA implementation (3 pts)
├── Password policies (1 pt)
└── Session management (1 pt)

Day 3-4: Full-Stack Developer + Backend Developer  
├── Audit logging system (2 pts)
├── Data encryption (1 pt)
└── GDPR compliance features (1 pt) 

Day 5: QA Engineer + Team
└── Security testing & validation
```

#### US-602: Advanced Rule Management System (6 points)
**Complexity Analysis:**
- **Technical Complexity**: Medium (6/10) - Visual builder, rule engine
- **Domain Complexity**: High (8/10) - Complex business logic
- **Effort**: Medium (6/10) - Primarily frontend with backend support
- **Risk**: Low (3/10) - Well-understood requirements

**Task Distribution:**
```
Day 1-2: Frontend Specialist + Full-Stack Developer
├── Visual rule builder UI (3 pts)
├── Drag-and-drop interface (2 pts)

Day 3-4: Backend Developer + Full-Stack Developer
├── Rule validation engine (1 pt)
├── Import/export functionality (1 pt)

Day 5: QA Engineer
└── Rule testing scenarios
```

### Daily Capacity Planning

#### Individual Developer Capacity
- **Junior Developer**: 4-6 points per sprint
- **Mid-level Developer**: 6-8 points per sprint  
- **Senior Developer**: 8-10 points per sprint
- **QA Engineer**: 4-6 points per sprint (testing focus)

#### Team Velocity Calculation
```
Team Capacity = (2 × 8 pts) + (1 × 6 pts) + (1 × 8 pts) + (1 × 5 pts)
Total Capacity = 16 + 6 + 8 + 5 = 35 points theoretical maximum

Applied Velocity Factor = 0.65 (accounting for meetings, blockers, etc.)
Realistic Sprint Capacity = 35 × 0.65 = ~23 points

Conservative Target = 19 points per sprint (buffer for unknowns)
```
