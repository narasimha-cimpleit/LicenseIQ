- [ ] Support 50+ concurrent users
- [ ] < 30 seconds average processing time
- [ ] 95%+ uptime
- [ ] Zero security vulnerabilities

## Risk Assessment
### Technical Risks:
- **LOW:** Groq API rate limits (mitigation: queue system)
- **LOW:** Database performance (mitigation: indexing, caching)
- **MEDIUM:** File processing errors (mitigation: error handling)

### Business Risks:
- **LOW:** User adoption (mitigation: intuitive UI)
- **LOW:** Scalability concerns (mitigation: cloud deployment)

## Next Steps for Production
1. **Testing Phase** - Comprehensive test coverage
2. **Documentation** - Complete technical documentation
3. **Deployment** - Production infrastructure setup
4. **Monitoring** - Observability and alerting
5. **Security Review** - Third-party security audit

## Resource Requirements
