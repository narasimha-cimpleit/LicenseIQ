## POC Development Plan: 3-Week Sprint Schedule

### ðŸ“‹ Sprint 1 (Week 1): Core Platform Foundation
1. **Backend Infrastructure** - Express.js + PostgreSQL setup
2. **Authentication System** - User management and RBAC
3. **Frontend Foundation** - React + TailwindCSS setup
4. **Basic File Upload** - Contract upload functionality

### ðŸ“‹ Sprint 2 (Week 2): AI Integration & Features
1. **Groq AI Integration** - LLaMA model integration
2. **Document Processing** - Text extraction and analysis
3. **User Interface** - Dashboard and analysis views
4. **Analytics Features** - Reporting and insights

### ðŸ“‹ Sprint 3 (Week 3): Testing & Completion
1. **Security Implementation** - Data protection and validation
2. **Testing Framework** - Comprehensive testing suite
3. **Error Handling** - Robust error management
4. **POC Finalization** - Documentation and demonstration

## POC Success Criteria
- [ ] Successfully process multiple document types (PDF, DOCX)
- [ ] Demonstrate AI-powered contract analysis capabilities
- [ ] Complete user authentication and role-based access
- [ ] Achieve < 30 seconds average processing time
- [ ] Implement basic security measures

## Risk Assessment
### Technical Risks:
- **LOW:** Groq API rate limits (mitigation: queue system)
- **LOW:** Database performance (mitigation: indexing, caching)
- **MEDIUM:** File processing errors (mitigation: error handling)

### Business Risks:
- **LOW:** User adoption (mitigation: intuitive UI)
- **LOW:** Scalability concerns (mitigation: cloud deployment)

## Post-POC Next Steps
1. **POC Evaluation** - Demonstrate platform capabilities
2. **Technical Validation** - Confirm architecture and approach
3. **Business Case** - Validate market readiness
4. **Production Planning** - Plan deployment for October 30-November 7
5. **Investment Decision** - Proceed to production phase

## Resource Requirements
### Current POC Environment:
- **Development:** Replit platform
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon)
- **AI Service:** Groq API
- **Storage:** Local filesystem

### Production Requirements:
- **Infrastructure:** Cloud platform (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- **Database:** Managed PostgreSQL
- **Storage:** Object storage (S3/GCS)
- **CDN:** Global content delivery
- **Monitoring:** Application and infrastructure monitoring

## Expected Outcomes
The 3-week Licence IQ Research Platform POC will demonstrate:
- AI-powered document analysis using Groq's LLaMA models
